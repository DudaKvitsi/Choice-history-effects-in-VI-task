# Choice-history-effects-in-VI-task
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
- MatLab software from MathWorks.
- Tested on MatLab 2017B and MatLab 2018B.

INSTALLATION GUIDE
- No need for installation. They can be run as any other MatLab script.


- Sessions of mice behavior with a VI task are in folders D001-D007.
- Sessions of human data are in Human_data_Jane
- Sessions of mice data running a VI task with different set reward probabilities are in folder Set_reward_probs
- Sessions of mice data running a VI task with different volatility in folder Volatility
- Sessions of mice data running a VI task with differennce in average set reward probability in folder Set_reward_probs_and_sum_probs

This datasets are sufficient to run all the scripts. 

- The run time of the scripts may vary.
* Approximate run time of scripts used for plotting: less than 2 minutes.
* Approximate run time of scripts used for prediction: between 10 and 40 minutes.
* Approximate run time of scripts used for simulation: between 5 and 15 hours.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
A deeper description of each script is in the script itself.
To generate the figure plots use scripts that start with F* for main figures and Suppl_* for supplemental figures
All the required functions are in the folder.
